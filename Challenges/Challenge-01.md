# Challenge 01 - Get onboard, the spaceship is taking off!

[Home](../README.md) - [Next Challenge >](Challenge-02.md)

## Introduction

In the year 2145, humanity had reached new heights in space exploration. The Quantum Seeker, a state-of-the-art spaceship, stood proudly on the launch pad at the Interstellar Spaceport. It was the culmination of decades of research, engineering, and dreams. Designed to explore the outer reaches of the Milky Way, it was equipped with the latest technology, including a revolutionary warp drive. The crew, a diverse team of scientists, engineers, and explorers, busily prepared for the journey ahead. The air was thick with anticipation and excitement; they were about to embark on a mission that would push the boundaries of human knowledge.

## Description

- Begin by creating a GitHub account that you can use for the mission. You may use an existing account if you have one already.

- Next, you will need your own repository to store your future codebase (dont forget to initialize!)
  
- Then, you set up [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview/) to be able to work on your code effectively.

- Finally, create your first code and push it to the repo! We will create a crew member profile.

Example:

MyRepo/myprofile.md

```hcl
resource "spaceship_crew_member" "elena_kim" {
  name        = "Elena Kim"
  experience  = "15 years"
  specialty   = "Space Medicine"
}
```


## Success Criteria

- Each member of your team has a github account, own repository and codespace running on it.
- Each member of your team has profile-as-code in their repo.
