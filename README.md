# Marchaton #1 - The Awakening

## Introduction

First episode of Marchaton is an engaging hands-on workshop designed to introduce you to collaborative coding and infrastructure management using Infrastructure as Code.

## Learning Objectives

Collaborative Coding on GitHub:
   - Repository Setup: Learn how to create and configure repositories on GitHub.
   - Branching: Explore the importance of branching and how to create and switch between branches.
   - Pull Requests and Merge: Master the process of making changes, committing them, and creating pull requests for collaborative review.

Terraform for Azure:
   - Setting Up Terraform: Install and configure Terraform on your local machine.
   - Target Platform Integration: Understand how to configure Terraform to work with target platform (Azure).
   - Defining and creating resources: Learn how to write Terraform configurations to create and manage a resource group in Azure.

By the end of this workshop, you will have a solid understanding of collaborative coding workflows on GitHub, as well as practical experience in using Terraform to manage cloud infrastructure on Azure. You'll leave with the confidence to contribute to projects, manage code collaboratively, and automate resource provisioning.
